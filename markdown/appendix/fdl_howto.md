G.11. How to use this License for your documents
------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

> Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
> distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free
> Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST
> THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the
> Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is included in the
> section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
